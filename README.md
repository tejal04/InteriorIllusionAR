These days, markets have a variety of options in furniture, be it the materials, colour, texture or size. It's often difficult for a customer to choose one amongst all the options. It would be of great help if the buyer could visualize a set of sofa or dining table in his living room, whether it suits at a particular place or fits in size rather than being disappointed later. 

Our mobile application, helps the user to visualize the furniture from the database options and also allows the user to place the item in the space they’re shopping for, view it from different angles, and determine if it is of the right size for their home or office. It helps the user simulate furniture and interior design products of their choice in 3D augmented reality in real time in the real environment from the convenience of their smartphone or tablet.
